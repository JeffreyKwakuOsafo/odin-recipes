        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. <br>
            You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. <br>
            My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! <br>
            Serve over rice.</p>
